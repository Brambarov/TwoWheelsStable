# TwoWheelsStable
An online application for motorcycle lovers. Users can register both themselves and their bikes. Each new motorcycle generates a call to an external API, which returns complete technical details for the brandÂ and model. A maintenance journal can be kept for each bike, images posted, and comments made by other users. In the future, I plan to provide a capability to list motorcycles for sale.
